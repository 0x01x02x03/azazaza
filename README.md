# Wexy-Backdoor
Wexy backdoor is a client/server C# application that I'm working on for fun. 
The server program must be ran on the victim's machine, and the hacker uses the client to connect to 
the server program which listens and executes commands sent from the client program.

Commands : 
write without the ''
(Open a website): 'open>http//example.com'
(Display a message on target's screen): 'msg>message here'
(Take a screenshot) 'ss>'
(Get the target's computer name) 'pcname>'
(Show files in a specified folder path - not working yet) 'showfiles>C:/users/example/desktop'
