# Wexy-Backdoor - [IN PROGRESS]
Wexy backdoor is a client/server C# application that I'm working on for fun. 
The server program must be ran on the victim's machine, and the hacker uses the client to connect to 
the server program which listens and executes commands sent from the client program.
It only works on a local network at the moment , as i'm using TcpClient / tcpListenner classes
